# ONS API Scripts

A place to gather helpful scripts and examples of how to extract data from ONS APIs. The [Developer Hub](developer.ons.gov.uk) contains official documentation of the APIs, these scripts are not a replacement for that.

Scripts in this repository may be available in R or Go, with relevant instructions on running in each case.

## List of datasets and their dimensions

This script is intended to give a high level overview of the data available through the ONS API.
It lists datasets, and the dimensions available within them so multiple datasets with similar 
dimensions or characteristics can easily be identified.

[R Script](r/README.md#list-of-datasets-and-their-dimensions)

[Go executable](dimensions-by-datasets/README.md)

## List of latest CSV URLs

This script lists datasets, their release frequency and the latest version CSV.
It could be extended to take seed data or filter the results to only a particular set of dataset IDs and editions.
